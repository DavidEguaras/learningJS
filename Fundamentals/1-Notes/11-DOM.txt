WEB API: DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL (DOM)


The DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript is an interface that represents the structure of a web page. 
It provides a way for scripts (like JavaScript) to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, 
and style of HTML and XML documents.

    -Document Representation: The DOM represents the document as a tree-like structure where each node represents an object in the document. 
    The document itself is the root node, with elements, attributes, and text as its branches and leaves.

    -Structu1red Hierarchy: Every elemaent in an HTML document, such as <body>, <p>, <div>, etc., is represented as a node in the DOM tree. 
    These nodes can be accessed, manipulated, added, or deleted using JavaScript.

    -JavaScript Interaction: JavaScript can interact with the DOM to perform various operations like accessing elements, modifying content, 
    changing styles, adding or removing elements, handling events, etc.

    -Dynamic Web Pages: The DOM enables the creation of dynamic web pages by allowing scripts to alter the content and structure of the page 
    in response to user actions, events, or other triggers.

    -Traversal and Manipulation: DOM methods and properties provide the ability to navigate through the document, find specific elements, 
    update content, change attributes, modify styles, and rearrange the structure.

    -Event Handling: JavaScript can listen for and respond to various events (e.g., clicks, mouse movements, keyboard inputs) on the web page 
    through the DOM. Event listeners can be attached to specific elements to trigger actions.

    -Cross-browser Consistency: While browsers may have their differences in implementing the DOM, efforts are made to maintain 
    consistency across different browsers by adhering to standards like the W3C DOM specifications.
