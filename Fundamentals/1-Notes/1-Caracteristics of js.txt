-Interpreted (java is compiled, js is interpreted)
     Interpreted languages have a very agile implementation since the code is read line by line, and allows us to be multiplatform, since it is independent of the OS
     in which it is executed

-Performance

-Dynamic Typing
     A statically typed object would be, for example, an object that cannot change shape, while a dynamic type refers to an object without shape, which
     can be defined and adapted to what we need
     It means that data types are evaluated at runtime.
     In a dynamically typed language, it is not necessary to explicitly declare the type of a variable when creating it,
     and this can change type during the execution of the program.
    
-Weakly typed
     It refers to the flexibility in converting data types into operations. In a weakly typed language,
     conversions between data types are performed automatically and less strictly, allowing operations
     between different types without the need for explicit conversion.
